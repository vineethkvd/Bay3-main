### 🌾What is *Bay3*?

**Bay3 (بيع بالعربية) It is a fully functional e-commerce application**, through which you can deal with features of (shopping **cart**, saving your **favorite** products, **making an order** using your **address**, and other features of similar applications). To complete this, I used Flutter and a Free API from  [Softagi](https://www.postman.com/cloudy-robot-179959/workspace/softagi/collection/16726323-31f7f27f-7aff-473e-8251-0520683c16f0?action=share&creator=29231079).

###  🌾Why did I build It?
I developed this project primarily to **sharpen my skills** in **building complex user interfaces**, improve my abilities to **consume APIs**, and handle the complex logic needed to **leverage the results returned from API requests**.

###  🕸️Features
- **Architecture:** MVVM architecture.
- **API requests:** using Dio package.
- **Local Storage:** Caching using SharedPrefrances.
